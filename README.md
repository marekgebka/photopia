# Photopia

Photopia is a Web App built in the **MEN** Stack (Mongo, Express and Node) built by [@darshancc23](https://github.com/darshancc23).
It involves building a simple media app around the upload of Images. Users can create an account using very little information
and are then able to upload new photos that they wish to share or comment on the ones already uploaded by others.
